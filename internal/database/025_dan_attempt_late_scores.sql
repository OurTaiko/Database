-- Migration 025 (as Fanmade 057): the scores of an attempt's songs are looked for up to half a minute after the
-- attempt too. The game starts uploading as soon as the first song's score is queued, so that
-- pass takes the first score and then the attempt; the other songs' scores follow in the next
-- pass, a few seconds after the attempt. 024 only looked before the attempt, and found the first
-- song's score alone. A song takes longer than half a minute, so the next attempt's scores are
-- not within reach; for the same reason an attempt does not look into the half minute after the
-- attempt before it.

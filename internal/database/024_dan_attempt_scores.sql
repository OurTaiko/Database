-- Migration 024: a 段位 attempt names the scores of its songs (as Fanmade 056). songs_played was how many songs
-- were played; it becomes their scores' ids in song order, so its length is still that count.
-- An element is NULL while the song's score is not known: it was never uploaded, or has not
-- arrived yet. score_keys are the Idempotency-Keys the game uploads those scores with, which is
-- how a score that arrives after its attempt is put in (POST /game/scores); empty for attempts
-- of games that do not send them.

-- The scores an attempt's songs most likely made, for attempts without score_keys: for each
-- song played, the player's latest score on that song's chart and course that came in after the
-- player's attempt before this one (at most an hour back) and before this one: the game uploads
-- a course's scores just before its attempt. A score that came later is not looked for, since it
-- could as well be the next attempt's. NULL where there is none.
